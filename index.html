    <p>I love Alien and I love Predator. <br> I did not much care for AvP as it was PG13. <br>I thought the Predator was phenominal!<br> If you didn't like it you don't like good movies! <br></p>
    <p>I also love crafting. I enjoy doing random spur of the moment crafts. <br>These crafts include perler bead projects and crafting stepping stones!<br></p>
